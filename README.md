# Congressional Earmarks Spending
### The data was found here: https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/
### In the project, I plan to look at who is using congressional earmarks and what they are being spent on. By sorting the dataset by "requestor_one_party," I am able to view spending patterns based on party affiliation, which is a major dividing factor in the US Government.
